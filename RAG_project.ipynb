However, the adoption of these technologies often comes with  trade-offs, including increased energy consumption, resource dependency,  and economic challenges. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence  (AI), renewable energy systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and carbon cap - ture solutions hold great potential to improve operational efficiency and reduce  environmental impacts. Yet, their implementation must be carefully managed  to avoid burden shifting, such as exacerbating energy demand, over-reliance  on critical raw materials, or creating unintended social and environmental con- sequences. This chapter examines the dual nature of technological advancements: their  capacity to drive sustainability while also presenting new complexities and  challenges.

Long-term  projections suggest significant growth in green bonds and sustainabili - ty-linked loans, providing essential funding for decarbonisation initiatives.  Businesses must prioritise reducing greenhouse gas emissions through  investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture  technologies. In addition, phasing out fossil fuels and transitioning to al - ternative raw materials are critical components of this shift. This includes  adopting bio-based, recycled, or renewable materials across industries to  reduce dependency on fossil-based resources. Access to green finance  will be crucial for funding these initiatives, making sustainability a key fac- tor in attracting investment.3 2 IPCC (2023); EEA (2023) 3 IDFC (2023); CPI (2023) The future of sustainability: Navigating trends and innovations for a sustainable tomorrow 39   ECONOMIC TRENDS IN SUSTAINABILITY Mid-term (2030-2040) – 1/2 Trend Description 1.2.1   Green finance98 Green finance is projected to significantly expand by 2030–2040, underpinned by growing demand  for sustainable investments and evolving regulatory frameworks.
